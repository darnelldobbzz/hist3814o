My classmate made an interesting annotation in Trevor's Ownens' [Sunrise on Methodology and Radical Transparency of Sources in Historical Writing](http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/), in which Owens' says, "Imagine what this kind of source transparency could do if it became standard practice for historical journals," in regards to the high level of source disclosure undertaken by Jeremy Suri in his Wired article.

What was most interesting to me about the post was the diversity of the conversation it led to as some of my fellow peers shared their opinions on the impact such transparency could cause. One the one hand the argument was made that such a level of transparency would lead to historians being more honest and balanced in their documentation of history. The other side of the argument was that it would not improve the equity of the history because historians could still use sources that supported their natural bias. 

Being a journalism student, what struck me the most was that the argument reminded me how similar the struggles historians face regarding [transparency of sources](http://www.gmj.uottawa.ca/1301/v6i1_heemsbergen.pdf) are to those faced by journalists. Simialar to historians, it is a core principle of journalism that bias be set aside for the sake of neutral reporting and documnetation of facts. However we have to recognize that the same piece of factual evidence can be interpreted in different ways to suit inherent biases. That being said I agree with the argument that transitioning towards the radical transparency of sources won't necessarily improve the balance of historical reporting and documentation.
